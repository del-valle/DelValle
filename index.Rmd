## About me  
Over the course of the initial steps of my career, my research has been mainly focused on the importance of non-pollinator mediated selection through the study of flavonoid accumulation in reproductive and vegetative tissues of plants and its implication for plant success in challenging ecosystems. I have also analyzed the plasticity of this phenotypic response, the ecological implications derived from the loss of anthocyanic pigments, and I proposed a non-invasive method to quantify anthocyanic concentrations in flowers of angiosperms by using digital images. Additionally, I have conducted other research involving different subjects, such as the transcriptional regulation of flower color polymorphism, the reconstruction of the phylogenetic relationships of species belonging to *Silene* section *Psammophilae*, or the study of the distribution of genetic diversity in an *Erysimum* species with an island-like distribution using genome skimming and microsatellites approaches, among others.
