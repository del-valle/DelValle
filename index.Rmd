## Bio  
José Carlos del Valle is a PhD in Biology that works at the University of Seville (Spain). His research has been mainly focused on the importance of non-pollinator mediated selection through the study of flavonoid accumulation in reproductive and vegetative tissues of plants and its implication for plant success in challenging ecosystems. Additionally, he has been conducting other research in others topics within the field of Evolutionary Biology, including the study of flower color polymorphism, population genetic and phylogeographic studies.
